List of problems:
- The version of pulsar-operator is wrong, it needs to be upgraded to 0.17.5, the solution is to create the catalogsource of sn, refer to sn-catalogsource.yaml
- The apikeys log reports that Pulsar is not available, and the broker log reports that the number of bookies is insufficient. The reason: because the replicas configuration is 1, which is inconsistent with the write configuration. The solution is to add the configuration PULSAR_PREFIX_managedLedgerDefaultEnsembleSize: "1";PULSAR_PREFIX_managedLedgerDefaultWriteQuorum: "1"; PULSAR_PREFIX_managedLedgerDefaultAckQuorum: "1"
- Console startup error imageCapabilities null pointer, the reason is that imageCapabilities failed to load because of wrong namespace (default sn_system), the solution is to add startup environment variable OPERATOR_NAMESPACE=operators
- To avoid the conflict between the installed sn-operator and the debug sn-operator, modify the deployment replicas of the installed sn-operator to 0
- Because of the webhook penetration problem, it is recommended to use kind to deploy the test locally
